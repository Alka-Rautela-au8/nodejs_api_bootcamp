MIDDLEWARE:
1. computer software
2. connects two applications and passes data between them.

the software consists of set of services that allows
multiple processes running on one or more machines to interact. 

const app = express()

//creating custom MIDDLEWARE
//takes request, response and next

const logger = (req, res, next) => {
    req.hello = 'Hello world';
    console.log('middleware ran')
    //calling next is necessary, so only it knows and moves on to 
    //the next piece of middle ware in the cycle
    next();
}

//for using it 
app.use(logger)

//now any request we make this logger function will run
//within all of our routes we have access to the variable (hello) we created 

-----------it is EXTREMELY POWERFUL-------------------------------


//this is how we can get variable
// @desc        Get all bootcamps
//@route        GET /api/v1/bootcamps
//@access       Public
exports.getBootcamps = (req, res, next) => {
    res.status(200).json({success: true, msg: 'Show all bootcamps', hello: req.hello});
}
