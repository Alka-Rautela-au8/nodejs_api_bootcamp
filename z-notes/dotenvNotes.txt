dotenv: 
Dotenv is a simple way to allow you to create secret keys 
that your application needs to function and keep them 
from going public.

1. zero dependency module
2. loads environment variable form .env
3. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

"scripts":{
    "start": "NODE_ENV=PRODUCTION node server"
}

Why there is need of .env module? 

Problem: 
Applications that rely on third-party sources 
for data will at some point need to include things 
like OAuth tokens, SSH keys, or API credentials. 
This becomes an issue when the code for 
the application gets pushed up to a public 
facing source control like GitHub. Once the code is 
up there it is accessible to anyone that sees it. 
And so are your keys.

solution:
One solution for this is to use environment variables. 
These are local variables that are made available to 
an application. Creating these variables is made 
easy with a tool like dotenv.
This module loads environment variables from a .env
file that you create and adds them to the process.env 
object that is made available to the application.
